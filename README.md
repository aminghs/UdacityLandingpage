## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of
the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static
project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS
files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the
Udacity Classroom.

## Development

To run this project locally, in your development folder, run
`npx http-server -c-1 -o` to run a local development server with no-cache
enabled and automatically opening your standard browser. Make some changes and
reload the browser and the changes are applied.

Enjoy!

## ES6

I used several ES6 methods and also Javascript and browser functions which are
only available in the latest modern browsers, e.g. `IntersectionObserver`.
Though those are working with the latest browsers except IE 11, IE 10 and Opera
mini/mobile.

Most of the changes have happened in the `js/app.js` file and some changes for
styling in `styles.css`

## Done

This project has been enhanced with dynamic generated Navigation list (based on
the sections) in an unordered list as well as scolling to the section.
